### Exploring the Associations of Income and Education Levels with Dietary Intakes
Dietary habits could be influenced by many factors, such as personal preferences, cultural rituals, age and etc. It is also associated with oneâ€™s social and economic status. In particular, many studies have shown that income and educational levels play a large part in influencing dietary intakes. Low income is often associated with a poor quality dietary intake. Some researchers suggested that people with lower education levels may consume larger amounts of unhealthy, calorically dense food than those with a higher education level, possibly because they are more likely to be engaged in jobs that require physical activities. While people with better education backgrounds and higher income tend to adopt healthier food choices. In this research, I will examine whether this trend is applicable in the context of the UK, based on various estimators of dietary intake from Tesco Grocery 1.0 dataset.
